# 🏠 Pattern Recognition – Housing Prices  

📌 **Description**  
This project was developed as part of a university assignment in Pattern Recognition.  
It uses Python and the `sklearn` library to analyze housing prices with different algorithms.  

👨‍💻 **Technologies used:**  
- Python  
- pandas  
- matplotlib (pyplot)  
- sklearn (MinMaxScaler, OneHotEncoder, regression models)  

⚡ **Features:**  
- Data preprocessing (drop missing values, normalization, one-hot encoding)  
- Data visualization with histograms and combined variable plots  
- Implemented algorithms:  
  - Perceptron (binary classification based on housing value)  
  - Least Squares regression  
  - sklearn Regression models  

📂 **Repository Contents:**  
- `documentation.pdf` → Full project documentation  
- `main.py` → Executes the full workflow  
- `pattern_rec.py` → Contains the `housing_price` class with core logic  
- `dataset/` → Dataset used for training & testing
